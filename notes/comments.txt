Comments are fundamental parts of a computer program, where you leave explanatory remarks to yourself and others that may be collaborating with you regarding your code.
All code you create for this course must include robust comments.
Typically each comment is a few words or more, providing the reader an opportunity to understand what is happening in a specific block of code. Further, such comments serve as a reminder for you later when you need to revise your code.
Comments involve placing // into your code, followed by a comment. Modify your code as follows to integrate comments:

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Prompt user for positive integer
    int n;
    do
    {
        n = get_int("Size: ");
    }
    while (n < 1);

    // Print an n-by-n grid of bricks
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

Notice how each comment begins with a //.
